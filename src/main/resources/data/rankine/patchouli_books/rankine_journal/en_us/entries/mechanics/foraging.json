Only the open hand or Flint, Bronze, Pewter, and Colored Gold tools are delicate enough to harves such crops. Any higher tier tool will not forage successfully unless the $(l:magic/enchantments#foraging)Foraging$() enchantment is applied.. Can set the chance for a vegetable to be found in the config. Set to 0 to disable."
