Dirt and Stone are at default speed along with all unaffected blocks. Grass Paths, Planks and their variants, and Polished Stones and their variants are slightly faster. Bricks, Stone Bricks, Concrete and their variants are next fastest. And finally, Roman Concrete is the fastest (approximately equivalent to speed 2)."
