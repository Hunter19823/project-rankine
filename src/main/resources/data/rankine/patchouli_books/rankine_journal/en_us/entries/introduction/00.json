Additionally, this will make you appreciate technological progress just that little bit more. Begin by finding $(l:mechanics/flint)flint$() (4 are needed at minimum to begin). Traditionally flint is derived from gravel at a 10% chance."

With rope, flint, and sticks any of the flint tools can be made (see the Tools category for more info on different tools).
