All vanilla tools are available, but there are additional tools to aid in the mining gaps. $(li)Stone and flint tools are harvest level 1 and can mine many of the surface ores which yield nuggets. $(li)Cobblestone comes from crushing stones. $(li)The use of most metals is either for crafting or tools, we want the latter to progress. $(li)New alloys are made in the alloy furnace. $(li)Bronze and Iron are harvest level 2 (Pewter also depending on the composition). $(li)Use the Material Testing Table"
