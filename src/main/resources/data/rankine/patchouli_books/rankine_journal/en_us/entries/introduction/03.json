It might be a little complicated at first, but reading the crucible page should help. Pro tips: shift click items in to see if they can be used, search by tag in JEI using $crucible_fluxes to see all of the potential materials."

If you didn't speedrun a portal, then now it's time to go to the Nether. There are a handful of new Resources to gather in the Nether. Many metals will allow you to make better alloys, woo! To do this, you can make upgraded machines like the $(machines.induction_furnace)Induction Furnace$() and $(machines/gyratory_crusher)Gyratory Crusher$()."

      "text": "With access to more elements, some more thought can be put into your alloy creation. Some considerations of importance are heat resistance and corrosion resistance. Mining in the Nether is a drain on tools without heat resistance. Each of the advanced tier alloy tools has niche. Tungsten has high heat resistance, chromium and nickel have high corrosion resistance, and cobalt has high mining speed. Any number of combination of elements could be the tool you never knew you needed."
